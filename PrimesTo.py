#Sieve of Eratosthenes:
#The algorithm works as follows.
    #Create a list l of consecutive integers {2,3,â€¦,N}.
    #Select p as the first prime number in the list, p=2.
    #Remove all multiples of p from the l.
    #set p equal to the next integer in l which has not been removed.
    #Repeat steps 3 and 4 until p**2 > N, all the remaining numbers in the list are primes
